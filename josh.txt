My name is Josh.
Description in three words: Music, Love, Growth
My favorite hobby is to play musical instruments.  My instruments of choice consist of drums and guitar.  My favorite animal to be around would easily be a dog, however, the most significant, impactful, and meaningful moments have been my encounters with hummingbirds.  I also love cooking and cultivating organic horticulture.
